dirk-vandecavey_GCO2: Before starting I'd like to understand the details of step 2. .. Web Components

GitHub Copilot: ### Step 2: Integrate Existing Websites Using Web Components

Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create custom, reusable HTML elements with encapsulated functionality. They are a good fit for a micro frontend architecture because they allow you to integrate different parts of your application independently.

#### Detailed Plan for Step 2

1. **Create a Web Component for Each Website**
   - Create a custom web component for each existing website.
   - Each web component will encapsulate an iframe that points to the respective website's port.

2. **Register the Web Components**
   - Register the custom web components using the `customElements.define` method.

3. **Use the Web Components in the Portal**
   - Add the custom web components to the portal's HTML.
   - Ensure each web component is displayed correctly and points to the correct port.

#### Example Implementation

1. **Create a Web Component for Each Website**

Create a JavaScript file for each web component, for example, `website1.js`, `website2.js`, and `website3.js`.

```javascript
class Website1 extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `<iframe src="http://localhost:2001" style="width:100%; height:100%; border:none;"></iframe>`;
  }
}

customElements.define('website-one', Website1);
```

```javascript
class Website2 extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `<iframe src="http://localhost:2002" style="width:100%; height:100%; border:none;"></iframe>`;
  }
}

customElements.define('website-two', Website2);
```

```javascript
class Website3 extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `<iframe src="http://localhost:2003" style="width:100%; height:100%; border:none;"></iframe>`;
  }
}

customElements.define('website-three', Website3);
```

2. **Register the Web Components**

Include the JavaScript files in your portal's HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Portal</title>
  <script src="website1.js" defer></script>
  <script src="website2.js" defer></script>
  <script src="website3.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Portal</h1>
  <input type="text" id="search-bar" placeholder="Search for a website...">
  <div id="website-list">
    <website-one></website-one>
    <website-two></website-two>
    <website-three></website-three>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

3. **Use the Web Components in the Portal**

Ensure each web component is displayed correctly and points to the correct port.

### Summary

By creating custom web components for each existing website, you can encapsulate the functionality and ensure minimal coupling. This approach allows you to integrate the websites into the portal without modifying them.

If you agree with this detailed plan for step 2, we can proceed with the implementation. Let me know if you have any questions or if you are ready to start.

dirk-vandecavey_GCO2: I am not yet convinced about the overall plan. Let's consider some use case before going over to implmentation. 

suppose each of the existing applications controls a specific business entity (say, products in product catalog, selected cart items, finally ordered products, respecitively). 
suppose I want to have an overview "box" in the poertal showing the number of products, the numer of cart items, the number of ordered products. 
How ould I realize that?

GitHub Copilot: To realize an overview "box" in the portal that shows the number of products, the number of cart items, and the number of ordered products, you can follow these steps:

### Use Case: Overview Box in the Portal

1. **Expose APIs in Existing Applications**
   - Ensure each existing application (products, cart items, ordered products) exposes an API endpoint that returns the required data (e.g., number of products, number of cart items, number of ordered products).

2. **Fetch Data from APIs in the Portal**
   - In the portal, use JavaScript to fetch data from the exposed APIs of each application.
   - Aggregate the data and display it in the overview box.

3. **Create the Overview Box Component**
   - Create a custom web component for the overview box.
   - Use the fetched data to populate the overview box.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Expose APIs in Existing Applications**

Ensure each application has an API endpoint that returns the required data. For example:

- **Products Application (localhost:2001)**
  ```json
  // GET http://localhost:2001/api/products/count
  {
    "count": 100
  }
  ```

- **Cart Items Application (localhost:2002)**
  ```json
  // GET http://localhost:2002/api/cart/count
  {
    "count": 5
  }
  ```

- **Ordered Products Application (localhost:2003)**
  ```json
  // GET http://localhost:2003/api/orders/count
  {
    "count": 20
  }
  ```

2. **Fetch Data from APIs in the Portal**

Create a JavaScript function to fetch data from the APIs and update the overview box.

```javascript
class OverviewBox extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Number of Products: <span id="product-count">Loading...</span></p>
        <p>Number of Cart Items: <span id="cart-count">Loading...</span></p>
        <p>Number of Ordered Products: <span id="order-count">Loading...</span></p>
      </div>
    `;
    this.fetchData();
  }

  async fetchData() {
    try {
      const productCount = await fetch('http://localhost:2001/api/products/count').then(res => res.json());
      const cartCount = await fetch('http://localhost:2002/api/cart/count').then(res => res.json());
      const orderCount = await fetch('http://localhost:2003/api/orders/count').then(res => res.json());

      this.querySelector('#product-count').textContent = productCount.count;
      this.querySelector('#cart-count').textContent = cartCount.count;
      this.querySelector('#order-count').textContent = orderCount.count;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    }
  }
}

customElements.define('overview-box', OverviewBox);
```

3. **Create the Overview Box Component**

Include the overview box component in your portal's HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Portal</title>
  <script src="overview-box.js" defer></script>
  <script src="website1.js" defer></script>
  <script src="website2.js" defer></script>
  <script src="website3.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Portal</h1>
  <input type="text" id="search-bar" placeholder="Search for a website...">
  <div id="overview">
    <overview-box></overview-box>
  </div>
  <div id="website-list">
    <website-one></website-one>
    <website-two></website-two>
    <website-three></website-three>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Summary

By exposing APIs in the existing applications and fetching data in the portal, you can create an overview box that displays the number of products, cart items, and ordered products. This approach maintains minimal coupling and allows you to integrate common features into the portal.

If you agree with this approach, we can proceed with the implementation. Let me know if you have any questions or if you are ready to start.

dirk-vandecavey_GCO2: The existing application are javascript applications, running soely in the browser of the user. Can I make those applications expose API's. I find that weird.  Maybe this is not what you meant?

GitHub Copilot: You are correct. If the existing applications are purely client-side and running in the user's browser, they cannot expose APIs in the traditional sense. Instead, we can use a different approach to achieve the same goal.

### Alternative Approach: Using Custom Events and Shared State

Instead of exposing APIs, we can use custom events and shared state to communicate between the portal and the existing applications. Each application can dispatch custom events with the required data, and the portal can listen for these events to update the overview box.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Modify Existing Applications to Dispatch Custom Events**
   - Each existing application will dispatch a custom event with the required data (e.g., number of products, number of cart items, number of ordered products).

2. **Listen for Custom Events in the Portal**
   - The portal will listen for these custom events and update the overview box accordingly.

### Example Implementation

1. **Modify Existing Applications to Dispatch Custom Events**

For each existing application, add code to dispatch a custom event with the required data.

- **Products Application (localhost:2001)**
  ```javascript
  // Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the products application
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const productCount = 100; // Replace with actual logic to get the product count
    const event = new CustomEvent('productCount', { detail: { count: productCount } });
    window.dispatchEvent(event);
  });
  ```

- **Cart Items Application (localhost:2002)**
  ```javascript
  // Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the cart items application
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const cartCount = 5; // Replace with actual logic to get the cart count
    const event = new CustomEvent('cartCount', { detail: { count: cartCount } });
    window.dispatchEvent(event);
  });
  ```

- **Ordered Products Application (localhost:2003)**
  ```javascript
  // Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the ordered products application
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const orderCount = 20; // Replace with actual logic to get the order count
    const event = new CustomEvent('orderCount', { detail: { count: orderCount } });
    window.dispatchEvent(event);
  });
  ```

2. **Listen for Custom Events in the Portal**

Create a JavaScript file for the overview box component in the portal.

```javascript
class OverviewBox extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Number of Products: <span id="product-count">Loading...</span></p>
        <p>Number of Cart Items: <span id="cart-count">Loading...</span></p>
        <p>Number of Ordered Products: <span id="order-count">Loading...</span></p>
      </div>
    `;
    this.setupEventListeners();
  }

  setupEventListeners() {
    window.addEventListener('productCount', (event) => {
      this.querySelector('#product-count').textContent = event.detail.count;
    });

    window.addEventListener('cartCount', (event) => {
      this.querySelector('#cart-count').textContent = event.detail.count;
    });

    window.addEventListener('orderCount', (event) => {
      this.querySelector('#order-count').textContent = event.detail.count;
    });
  }
}

customElements.define('overview-box', OverviewBox);
```

Include the overview box component in your portal's HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Portal</title>
  <script src="overview-box.js" defer></script>
  <script src="website1.js" defer></script>
  <script src="website2.js" defer></script>
  <script src="website3.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Portal</h1>
  <input type="text" id="search-bar" placeholder="Search for a website...">
  <div id="overview">
    <overview-box></overview-box>
  </div>
  <div id="website-list">
    <website-one></website-one>
    <website-two></website-two>
    <website-three></website-three>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Summary

By using custom events and shared state, you can achieve communication between the portal and the existing client-side applications. This approach maintains minimal coupling and allows you to integrate common features into the portal.

If you agree with this approach, we can proceed with the implementation. Let me know if you have any questions or if you are ready to start.

dirk-vandecavey_GCO2: Can you explain this step first, in more detail
Modify Existing Applications to Dispatch Custom Events
For each existing application, add code to dispatch a custom event with the required data.

Especially, I am wondering whether adding this "custom event" will make existing applications behave strangely, in the case that tey are not deployed in the portal context, but they are deployed as standalone components.

GitHub Copilot: Adding custom events to the existing applications should not affect their standalone behavior. Custom events are a way to communicate between different parts of an application or between different applications running in the same context (e.g., the portal). When the applications are running standalone, these custom events will simply not be listened to, and the applications will behave as they normally do.

### Detailed Explanation: Modify Existing Applications to Dispatch Custom Events

1. **Identify the Data to Dispatch**
   - Determine the data you need from each application (e.g., number of products, number of cart items, number of ordered products).

2. **Add Code to Dispatch Custom Events**
   - Add JavaScript code to each application to dispatch a custom event with the required data when the application is loaded.

3. **Ensure No Impact on Standalone Behavior**
   - The custom event dispatch code will not interfere with the normal operation of the applications when they are running standalone.

### Example Implementation

#### Products Application (localhost:2001)

1. **Identify the Data to Dispatch**
   - Number of products.

2. **Add Code to Dispatch Custom Events**
   - Add the following code to the main JavaScript file of the products application:

```javascript
// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the products application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const productCount = 100; // Replace with actual logic to get the product count
  const event = new CustomEvent('productCount', { detail: { count: productCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});
```

#### Cart Items Application (localhost:2002)

1. **Identify the Data to Dispatch**
   - Number of cart items.

2. **Add Code to Dispatch Custom Events**
   - Add the following code to the main JavaScript file of the cart items application:

```javascript
// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the cart items application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const cartCount = 5; // Replace with actual logic to get the cart count
  const event = new CustomEvent('cartCount', { detail: { count: cartCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});
```

#### Ordered Products Application (localhost:2003)

1. **Identify the Data to Dispatch**
   - Number of ordered products.

2. **Add Code to Dispatch Custom Events**
   - Add the following code to the main JavaScript file of the ordered products application:

```javascript
// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the ordered products application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const orderCount = 20; // Replace with actual logic to get the order count
  const event = new CustomEvent('orderCount', { detail: { count: orderCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});
```

### Summary

By adding the custom event dispatch code to each application, you enable the portal to listen for these events and update the overview box accordingly. This approach ensures that the existing applications will continue to function normally when running standalone, as the custom events will simply not be listened to in that context.

If you agree with this approach, we can proceed with the implementation. Let me know if you have any questions or if you are ready to start.

dirk-vandecavey_GCO2: not yet ....
I see "document.addEventListener". And I wonder, who actually produces this event, that this listener is listening to.


GitHub Copilot: The `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', ...)` is a standard event listener that listens for the `DOMContentLoaded` event, which is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading. This is a common way to run JavaScript code after the document is ready.

In the context of our custom events, the `DOMContentLoaded` event is used to ensure that the custom event dispatch code runs after the document is fully loaded. The custom events (`productCount`, `cartCount`, `orderCount`) are then dispatched by the applications themselves.

### Clarification on Custom Events

1. **`DOMContentLoaded` Event Listener**
   - This listener ensures that the custom event dispatch code runs after the document is fully loaded.

2. **Dispatching Custom Events**
   - The custom events (`productCount`, `cartCount`, `orderCount`) are created and dispatched by the applications themselves. These events are not produced by the `DOMContentLoaded` event but are triggered within the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to ensure the document is ready.

### Example Implementation

#### Products Application (localhost:2001)

1. **`DOMContentLoaded` Event Listener**
   - Ensures the custom event dispatch code runs after the document is fully loaded.

2. **Dispatching Custom Event**
   - Dispatches the `productCount` custom event with the required data.

```javascript
// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the products application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const productCount = 100; // Replace with actual logic to get the product count
  const event = new CustomEvent('productCount', { detail: { count: productCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});
```

#### Cart Items Application (localhost:2002)

1. **`DOMContentLoaded` Event Listener**
   - Ensures the custom event dispatch code runs after the document is fully loaded.

2. **Dispatching Custom Event**
   - Dispatches the `cartCount` custom event with the required data.

```javascript
// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the cart items application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const cartCount = 5; // Replace with actual logic to get the cart count
  const event = new CustomEvent('cartCount', { detail: { count: cartCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});
```

#### Ordered Products Application (localhost:2003)

1. **`DOMContentLoaded` Event Listener**
   - Ensures the custom event dispatch code runs after the document is fully loaded.

2. **Dispatching Custom Event**
   - Dispatches the `orderCount` custom event with the required data.

```javascript
// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the ordered products application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const orderCount = 20; // Replace with actual logic to get the order count
  const event = new CustomEvent('orderCount', { detail: { count: orderCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});
```

### Summary

The `DOMContentLoaded` event listener ensures that the custom event dispatch code runs after the document is fully loaded. The custom events (`productCount`, `cartCount`, `orderCount`) are then created and dispatched by the applications themselves. These custom events can be listened to by the portal to update the overview box.

If you agree with this approach, we can proceed with the implementation. Let me know if you have any questions or if you are ready to start.

dirk-vandecavey_GCO2:  not yet  ... "after the document is fully loaded." 
 which document are we talking about here?
 

GitHub Copilot: I understand your concern. Let's clarify the context and the flow of events.

### Context and Flow of Events

1. **Existing Applications**: These are the Angular and React applications running on different ports (localhost:2001, localhost:2002, localhost:2003).
2. **Portal**: This is the new application that will integrate the existing applications and provide an overview box.

### Document Context

- **Existing Applications**: Each existing application has its own HTML document.
- **Portal**: The portal has its own HTML document.

### Custom Events in Existing Applications

The `DOMContentLoaded` event listener in each existing application ensures that the custom event dispatch code runs after the respective application's HTML document is fully loaded. This means that the custom events are dispatched by the existing applications themselves.

### Example Implementation

#### Products Application (localhost:2001)

1. **`DOMContentLoaded` Event Listener**
   - Ensures the custom event dispatch code runs after the products application's HTML document is fully loaded.

2. **Dispatching Custom Event**
   - Dispatches the `productCount` custom event with the required data.

```javascript
// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the products application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const productCount = 100; // Replace with actual logic to get the product count
  const event = new CustomEvent('productCount', { detail: { count: productCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});
```

#### Cart Items Application (localhost:2002)

1. **`DOMContentLoaded` Event Listener**
   - Ensures the custom event dispatch code runs after the cart items application's HTML document is fully loaded.

2. **Dispatching Custom Event**
   - Dispatches the `cartCount` custom event with the required data.

```javascript
// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the cart items application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const cartCount = 5; // Replace with actual logic to get the cart count
  const event = new CustomEvent('cartCount', { detail: { count: cartCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});
```

#### Ordered Products Application (localhost:2003)

1. **`DOMContentLoaded` Event Listener**
   - Ensures the custom event dispatch code runs after the ordered products application's HTML document is fully loaded.

2. **Dispatching Custom Event**
   - Dispatches the `orderCount` custom event with the required data.

```javascript
// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the ordered products application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const orderCount = 20; // Replace with actual logic to get the order count
  const event = new CustomEvent('orderCount', { detail: { count: orderCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});
```

### Listening for Custom Events in the Portal

The portal will listen for these custom events and update the overview box accordingly.

```javascript
class OverviewBox extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Number of Products: <span id="product-count">Loading...</span></p>
        <p>Number of Cart Items: <span id="cart-count">Loading...</span></p>
        <p>Number of Ordered Products: <span id="order-count">Loading...</span></p>
      </div>
    `;
    this.setupEventListeners();
  }

  setupEventListeners() {
    window.addEventListener('productCount', (event) => {
      this.querySelector('#product-count').textContent = event.detail.count;
    });

    window.addEventListener('cartCount', (event) => {
      this.querySelector('#cart-count').textContent = event.detail.count;
    });

    window.addEventListener('orderCount', (event) => {
      this.querySelector('#order-count').textContent = event.detail.count;
    });
  }
}

customElements.define('overview-box', OverviewBox);
```

### Summary

- **Existing Applications**: Dispatch custom events after their own HTML documents are fully loaded.
- **Portal**: Listens for these custom events and updates the overview box.

This approach ensures that the existing applications will continue to function normally when running standalone, as the custom events will simply not be listened to in that context.

If you agree with this approach, we can proceed with the implementation. Let me know if you have any questions or if you are ready to start.

dirk-vandecavey_GCO2: not yet.
SO an application loads its" HTML document"  And each load will then call the event dispatcher. 
The logic in the event dispatcher mus create an event "with meaningfull content" that is then available for a portal that "listens" to the event? 

GitHub Copilot: Yes, that's correct. Each application will load its own HTML document and, upon loading, will dispatch a custom event with meaningful content (e.g., the number of products, cart items, or ordered products). The portal will listen for these custom events and update the overview box accordingly.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Modify Existing Applications to Dispatch Custom Events**
   - Each application will dispatch a custom event with the required data when its HTML document is fully loaded.

2. **Listen for Custom Events in the Portal**
   - The portal will listen for these custom events and update the overview box with the received data.

### Example Implementation

#### Products Application (localhost:2001)

1. **Dispatch Custom Event**
   - Add the following code to the main JavaScript file of the products application to dispatch a custom event with the product count.

```javascript
// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the products application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const productCount = 100; // Replace with actual logic to get the product count
  const event = new CustomEvent('productCount', { detail: { count: productCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});
```

#### Cart Items Application (localhost:2002)

1. **Dispatch Custom Event**
   - Add the following code to the main JavaScript file of the cart items application to dispatch a custom event with the cart count.

```javascript
// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the cart items application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const cartCount = 5; // Replace with actual logic to get the cart count
  const event = new CustomEvent('cartCount', { detail: { count: cartCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});
```

#### Ordered Products Application (localhost:2003)

1. **Dispatch Custom Event**
   - Add the following code to the main JavaScript file of the ordered products application to dispatch a custom event with the order count.

```javascript
// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the ordered products application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const orderCount = 20; // Replace with actual logic to get the order count
  const event = new CustomEvent('orderCount', { detail: { count: orderCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});
```

### Listening for Custom Events in the Portal

Create a JavaScript file for the overview box component in the portal.

```javascript
class OverviewBox extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Number of Products: <span id="product-count">Loading...</span></p>
        <p>Number of Cart Items: <span id="cart-count">Loading...</span></p>
        <p>Number of Ordered Products: <span id="order-count">Loading...</span></p>
      </div>
    `;
    this.setupEventListeners();
  }

  setupEventListeners() {
    window.addEventListener('productCount', (event) => {
      this.querySelector('#product-count').textContent = event.detail.count;
    });

    window.addEventListener('cartCount', (event) => {
      this.querySelector('#cart-count').textContent = event.detail.count;
    });

    window.addEventListener('orderCount', (event) => {
      this.querySelector('#order-count').textContent = event.detail.count;
    });
  }
}

customElements.define('overview-box', OverviewBox);
```

Include the overview box component in your portal's HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Portal</title>
  <script src="overview-box.js" defer></script>
  <script src="website1.js" defer></script>
  <script src="website2.js" defer></script>
  <script src="website3.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Portal</h1>
  <input type="text" id="search-bar" placeholder="Search for a website...">
  <div id="overview">
    <overview-box></overview-box>
  </div>
  <div id="website-list">
    <website-one></website-one>
    <website-two></website-two>
    <website-three></website-three>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Summary

- **Existing Applications**: Dispatch custom events with meaningful content (e.g., product count, cart count, order count) when their HTML documents are fully loaded.
- **Portal**: Listens for these custom events and updates the overview box with the received data.

This approach ensures that the existing applications will continue to function normally when running standalone, as the custom events will simply not be listened to in that context.

If you agree with this approach, we can proceed with the implementation. Let me know if you have any questions or if you are ready to start.

dirk-vandecavey_GCO2: Still discussing the overall plan here. 

Do you see "Module Federation" enter into this solution at any moment? As far as I can see, you have not considered this approach at all so far. 


GitHub Copilot: You're right. Module Federation is another approach that can be considered for integrating micro frontends. It allows multiple independently built and deployed applications to share code and dependencies at runtime. This can be particularly useful for integrating existing applications into a portal.

### Revised Plan: Using Module Federation

1. **Set Up the Portal Project**
   - Create a new project for the portal using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Set up the basic structure of the portal with a search bar and a list of websites.

2. **Configure Module Federation in Existing Applications**
   - Modify the existing Angular and React applications to expose their components using Module Federation.
   - Ensure each application is configured to share dependencies and expose the necessary modules.

3. **Integrate Existing Applications into the Portal**
   - Use Module Federation to dynamically load and render components from the existing applications within the portal.
   - Ensure the portal can communicate with the loaded components to fetch and display the required data.

4. **Implement Search Functionality**
   - Add JavaScript to filter the list of websites based on user input in the search bar.
   - Show or hide components based on the search results.

5. **Styling the Portal**
   - Use CSS to style the portal, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly interface.
   - Make sure the portal is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

6. **Add Common Features**
   - Identify common features to be integrated into the portal (e.g., authentication, notifications).
   - Implement these features in a way that they do not impact the existing websites.

7. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test the portal to ensure all features work as expected.
   - Debug any issues that arise during testing.

8. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the portal to a web server.
   - Ensure the portal and the embedded websites are accessible and functioning correctly.

### Detailed Steps for Module Federation

1. **Set Up the Portal Project**
   - Create a new project for the portal using a framework like React or Angular.
   - Set up the basic structure of the portal with a search bar and a list of websites.

2. **Configure Module Federation in Existing Applications**

   - **Angular Applications (localhost:2001, localhost:2002)**
     - Modify the `webpack.config.js` to expose the necessary modules.
     - Example configuration:
       ```javascript
       // webpack.config.js
       const ModuleFederationPlugin = require("webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin");

       module.exports = {
         // ...existing configuration...
         plugins: [
           new ModuleFederationPlugin({
             name: "app1",
             filename: "remoteEntry.js",
             exposes: {
               "./ProductComponent": "./src/app/product/product.component.ts",
             },
             shared: ["@angular/core", "@angular/common", "@angular/router"],
           }),
         ],
       };
       ```

   - **React Application (localhost:2003)**
     - Modify the `webpack.config.js` to expose the necessary modules.
     - Example configuration:
       ```javascript
       // webpack.config.js
       const ModuleFederationPlugin = require("webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin");

       module.exports = {
         // ...existing configuration...
         plugins: [
           new ModuleFederationPlugin({
             name: "app3",
             filename: "remoteEntry.js",
             exposes: {
               "./OrderComponent": "./src/components/OrderComponent.jsx",
             },
             shared: ["react", "react-dom"],
           }),
         ],
       };
       ```

3. **Integrate Existing Applications into the Portal**

   - **Portal Configuration**
     - Modify the `webpack.config.js` of the portal to consume the exposed modules.
     - Example configuration:
       ```javascript
       // webpack.config.js
       const ModuleFederationPlugin = require("webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin");

       module.exports = {
         // ...existing configuration...
         plugins: [
           new ModuleFederationPlugin({
             name: "portal",
             remotes: {
               app1: "app1@http://localhost:2001/remoteEntry.js",
               app2: "app2@http://localhost:2002/remoteEntry.js",
               app3: "app3@http://localhost:2003/remoteEntry.js",
             },
             shared: ["react", "react-dom"],
           }),
         ],
       };
       ```

   - **Dynamically Load Components**
     - Use dynamic imports to load and render components from the existing applications within the portal.
     - Example:
       ```javascript
       // In a React component
       import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

       const ProductComponent = React.lazy(() => import("app1/ProductComponent"));
       const CartComponent = React.lazy(() => import("app2/CartComponent"));
       const OrderComponent = React.lazy(() => import("app3/OrderComponent"));

       const OverviewBox = () => {
         return (
           <div>
             <h2>Overview</h2>
             <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
               <ProductComponent />
               <CartComponent />
               <OrderComponent />
             </React.Suspense>
           </div>
         );
       };

       export default OverviewBox;
       ```

### Summary

Using Module Federation allows you to integrate existing applications into the portal dynamically, sharing code and dependencies at runtime. This approach maintains minimal coupling and enables the integration of common features into the portal.

If you agree with this revised plan, we can proceed with the implementation. Let me know if you have any questions or if you are ready to start.

dirk-vandecavey_GCO2: Can you consider the two approaches next to one another and show the pros and cons of both. 

GitHub Copilot: ### Comparison of Approaches: Custom Events vs. Module Federation

#### Approach 1: Custom Events

**Pros:**
- **Minimal Coupling**: Existing applications remain largely unchanged and continue to function independently.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand, especially for small-scale integrations.
- **No Build Changes**: No need to modify the build configuration of existing applications.

**Cons:**
- **Limited Communication**: Custom events are suitable for simple data sharing but may become cumbersome for more complex interactions.
- **Manual Event Handling**: Requires manual setup of event listeners and dispatchers.
- **Scalability**: May not scale well for larger applications with more complex interactions.

#### Approach 2: Module Federation

**Pros:**
- **Dynamic Integration**: Allows for dynamic loading and sharing of components and dependencies at runtime.
- **Scalability**: Scales well for larger applications and more complex interactions.
- **Code Sharing**: Enables sharing of code and dependencies between applications, reducing duplication.
- **Flexibility**: Provides a flexible architecture for integrating micro frontends.

**Cons:**
- **Complexity**: More complex to set up and configure, especially for developers unfamiliar with Webpack and Module Federation.
- **Build Configuration**: Requires changes to the build configuration of existing applications.
- **Initial Setup Time**: May take longer to set up initially compared to custom events.

### Summary

#### Custom Events
- **Best For**: Simple integrations with minimal changes to existing applications.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for small-scale projects where minimal coupling and simplicity are prioritized.

#### Module Federation
- **Best For**: Complex integrations requiring dynamic loading and sharing of components.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for larger projects where scalability, flexibility, and code sharing are important.

### Recommendation

Given the requirements and the technologies involved (Angular, React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS), **Module Federation** is a more robust and scalable solution for integrating the existing applications into the portal. It allows for dynamic loading and sharing of components, making it easier to manage and scale the portal as it grows.

If you agree with this recommendation, we can proceed with the implementation of Module Federation. Let me know if you have any questions or if you are ready to start.

dirk-vandecavey_GCO2: Seems like that for "Module Federation" the coupling is a lot tighter, actually coupling at component/deployment level. yes?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you are correct. Module Federation does introduce tighter coupling at the component and deployment level compared to custom events. Let's summarize the key differences in terms of coupling and other factors:

### Custom Events

**Coupling:**
- **Loose Coupling**: Custom events allow for loose coupling between the portal and existing applications. Each application can function independently, and the portal listens for events without needing to know the internal details of the applications.

**Pros:**
- **Minimal Changes**: Requires minimal changes to existing applications.
- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and understand.
- **Independence**: Applications remain independent and can be deployed separately.

**Cons:**
- **Limited Communication**: Suitable for simple data sharing but may become cumbersome for complex interactions.
- **Manual Setup**: Requires manual setup of event listeners and dispatchers.

### Module Federation

**Coupling:**
- **Tighter Coupling**: Module Federation introduces tighter coupling at the component and deployment level. Applications share code and dependencies, and the portal dynamically loads components from the applications.

**Pros:**
- **Dynamic Integration**: Allows for dynamic loading and sharing of components and dependencies at runtime.
- **Scalability**: Scales well for larger applications with more complex interactions.
- **Code Sharing**: Reduces duplication by sharing code and dependencies between applications.

**Cons:**
- **Complexity**: More complex to set up and configure.
- **Build Configuration**: Requires changes to the build configuration of existing applications.
- **Initial Setup Time**: May take longer to set up initially.

### Summary

**Custom Events**:
- **Best For**: Simple integrations with minimal changes to existing applications.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for small-scale projects where minimal coupling and simplicity are prioritized.

**Module Federation**:
- **Best For**: Complex integrations requiring dynamic loading and sharing of components.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for larger projects where scalability, flexibility, and code sharing are important.

### Recommendation

Given the requirement for minimal coupling and the technologies involved (Angular, React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS), **Custom Events** might be a more suitable approach for your project. It allows the existing applications to remain independent and minimizes the impact on their deployment and build configurations.

If you agree with this recommendation, we can proceed with the implementation of the custom events approach. Let me know if you have any questions or if you are ready to start.

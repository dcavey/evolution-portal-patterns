// Add this code to the main JavaScript file of the cart items application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const cartCount = 5; // Replace with actual logic to get the cart count
  const event = new CustomEvent('cartCount', { detail: { count: cartCount } });
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
});

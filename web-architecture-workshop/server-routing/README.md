# Server Routing Architecture

This project demonstrates the Server Routing architecture, which utilizes dynamic server-side rendering to generate pages based on user interactions. 

## Overview

In a Server Routing application, each request to the server results in a new page being generated dynamically. This approach allows for the creation of dynamic content that can change based on user input or other factors, while still maintaining a clear URL structure.

## Characteristics

- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Pages are generated on-the-fly using server-side logic, allowing for personalized and context-aware content.
- **URL-Based Navigation**: Each page has a unique URL, making it easy for users to bookmark and share links.
- **Improved Flexibility**: Unlike static pages, server-rendered pages can adapt to different data inputs and user interactions.

## Use Cases

Server Routing is ideal for applications that require dynamic content, such as:

- Content management systems (CMS)
- E-commerce platforms
- User dashboards and profiles

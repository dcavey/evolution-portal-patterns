# Linked Pages Architecture

## Overview
Linked Pages, also known as Traditional Multi-Page Applications (MPAs), represent the foundational architecture of web applications. In this model, every interaction with the application results in a full-page reload, where the browser fetches a completely new HTML document from the server.

## Characteristics
- **Clear Separation of Pages**: Each page is distinct, allowing for a straightforward organization of content.
- **Minimal Client-Side Interactivity**: The user experience is primarily driven by server responses, with limited interactivity on the client side.
- **Straightforward Navigation**: Users navigate through links that lead to different pages, making it easy to understand the structure of the application.

## Use Cases
Linked Pages are suitable for applications where:
- Content is primarily static and does not require frequent updates.
- SEO is a significant concern, as each page can be indexed separately by search engines.
- Simplicity is key, and the overhead of client-side frameworks is unnecessary.

## Conclusion
While Linked Pages may feel slower and more disjointed compared to modern single-page applications, they provide a reliable and easy-to-understand structure for many web applications. This architecture serves as a stepping stone to more interactive and dynamic web experiences.

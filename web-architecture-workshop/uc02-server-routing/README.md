# Server Routing (Dynamic Server-Rendered Applications)

## What it is
Pages are generated dynamically on the server using routing logic.

## How it works
Although each navigation still results in a new full page load, the content is generated on the fly (e.g., via server-side templating).

## Characteristics
- Dynamic content generation
- Maintains URL-based navigation
- Improved flexibility over static pages

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the `uc2-server-routing` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install

   To realize the solution to the problem stated in the requirements document, you
   can consider the following scenarios:

   Each of these scenarios has its own advantages and trade-offs. Choose the one
   that best fits your requirements and development environment.

   Provide pros and cons for each approach.
   - minimal coupling ( no impact on existing websites is preferred)
   - integration of specific common features in the portal should be possible

   ### Scenario 1: Single Page Application (SPA) with JavaScript Framework

   **Pros:**
   - **Rich User Experience**: Provides a dynamic and responsive user interface.
   - **Component Reusability**: Easy to reuse components across the portal.

   **Cons:**
   - **Initial Load Time**: May have a longer initial load time due to the size of the JavaScript bundle.
   - **SEO Challenges**: Requires additional configuration for SEO optimization.

   ### Recommendation
   Given the requirement for minimal coupling and the ability to integrate common
   features,
   **Scenario 5: Micro Frontends** is a strong candidate. It allows for independent
   development and deployment of each website, minimizing the impact on existing
   websites. Additionally, it provides the flexibility to integrate common features
   at the portal level.

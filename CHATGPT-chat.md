# Chat Transcript

**You said**:

   Trying to make access to may applications easier. Need a portal?
   I have three javascript applications.

**Application A**:

   runs at http://localhost:2001

**Application B**:

   runs at http://localhost:2002

**Application C**:

   runs at http://localhost:2003

   I want one application, a portal, that allows me to switch to one of these applications.
   None of these applications is willing (or able) to change any of their code to make things easy for
   me. They want to remain independent.

   What is the best approach I can take?

**Chatgpt said**:

   The cleanest solution is to “wrap” your applications with a reverse proxy so that you can serve them
   from a single domain/port without having to change any of their code.

   Why a Reverse Proxy?

**Unified URL Space**:

   By using a reverse proxy (e.g., with Nginx, Apache, or a Node.js proxy middleware), you can map
   different URL paths (or even subdomains) to each of your apps. For example:

**http**:

   //myportal/appA → proxies to http://localhost:2001

**http**:

   //myportal/appB → proxies to http://localhost:2002

**http**:

   //myportal/appC → proxies to http://localhost:2003
   This allows you to have a single “portal” application that provides navigation among them without
   having to deal with cross-origin issues.

**No Code Changes Needed**:

   Since your individual applications don’t need to be aware of the integration, they can continue to
   operate exactly as they do now. The reverse proxy handles the URL rewriting and routing
   transparently.

**Avoiding Cross-Origin Problems**:

   If you were to simply embed the apps using iframes or links from a portal running on a different
   port, you’d likely run into cross-origin issues. The reverse proxy ensures that all requests appear
   to come from the same origin.

   How to Implement It

**Set Up the Reverse Proxy**:



**Nginx Example**:

   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name myportal;

       location /appA/ {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:2001/;
       }

       location /appB/ {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:2002/;
       }

       location /appC/ {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:2003/;
       }
   }

**Apache Example**:

   You can use the mod_proxy module to achieve similar results.

**Create Your Portal**:

   Build a simple portal (even a static HTML page) that provides navigation (links or buttons) to
   /appA, /appB, and /appC.
   Optionally, if you want to have a more integrated feel, you can embed the applications in iframes.
   Just keep in mind that if the apps have policies (e.g., X-Frame-Options) that disallow framing, you
   might have to stick to navigation links.

**Alternative**:

   Iframes
   While you might consider embedding the apps via iframes in your portal, this can be problematic if:

   The apps set security headers (like X-Frame-Options) that prevent embedding.
   They rely on full-page navigation (which is harder to manage inside an iframe).
   Given that none of your apps are willing or able to change their code, the reverse proxy is the more
   robust and future-proof solution.

   In Summary
   The best approach is to set up a reverse proxy that routes requests to the appropriate application
   based on the URL path (or subdomain). This lets you build a unified portal without modifying the
   independent applications, and it sidesteps potential cross-origin and framing issues.

**You said**:

   I have tried that.

   Here is the code, I have

   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name myportal;

       location /appA/ {
           proxy_pass http://3.250.227.215:2001/;
           proxy_redirect default;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }

       location /appB/ {
           proxy_pass http://3.250.227.215:2002/;
           proxy_redirect default;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }

       location /appC/ {
           proxy_pass http://3.250.227.215:2003/;
           proxy_redirect default;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }

   Upon running this I get this error.
   $curl localhost/appA
   <html>
   <head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
   <body>
   <center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>
   <hr><center>nginx/1.27.4</center>
   </body>
   </html>
   $

   what could be wrong?

**Chatgpt said**:

   When you request /appA (without the trailing slash), Nginx isn’t matching your location block
   (location /appA/ { … }) exactly, so it automatically sends a 301 redirect to /appA/.

   What’s Happening

**Location Matching**:

   Your location block is defined for /appA/ (with a trailing slash). When you call curl
   localhost/appA, the URI doesn’t include the trailing slash. Nginx then issues a redirect to the
   “correct” URI (i.e. /appA/).

**Result**:

   You see the 301 Moved Permanently response because Nginx is telling your client to try /appA/
   instead.
   How to Fix

**Include the Trailing Slash in Your Request**:

   Instead of calling curl localhost/appA, try:
   bash
   Copy
   Edit
   curl localhost/appA/
   This request will match your location block exactly and proxy to the correct backend.
   Optionally, Add an Explicit Redirect:

   If you want /appA (without the slash) to work seamlessly, you can add a separate location block that
   redirects to /appA/:
   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   location = /appA {
       return 301 /appA/;
   }

   location /appA/ {
       proxy_pass http://3.250.227.215:2001/;
       proxy_redirect default;
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
   }
   This way, any request to /appA will be automatically redirected to /appA/.
   Summary
   The 301 error is caused by the missing trailing slash. Either always use /appA/ in your requests or
   add a redirect in your configuration so that requests to /appA are handled properly.

**You said**:

   For the curl that did the trick.

   However when I use a browser I get this error

**Request URL**:



**http**:

   //localhost/styles-5INURTSO.css

**Request Method**:

   GET

**Status Code**:

   404 Not Found

**Remote Address**:

   [::1]:80

**Referrer Policy**:

   strict-origin-when-cross-origin

**Chatgpt said**:

   The issue is that your proxied application is referencing its assets (like styles-5INURTSO.css)
   using absolute paths. When your browser sees a reference like:

   html
   Copy
   Edit
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles-5INURTSO.css">

**it interprets it as a request to http**:

   //localhost/styles-5INURTSO.css instead of http://localhost/appA/styles-5INURTSO.css. Since nothing
   is serving files at the root (/), you get a 404 error.

   Why This Happens
   When you set up your reverse proxy under a subpath (e.g., /appA/), you’re effectively “mounting” the
   application at that location. However, if the application itself generates links to assets using
   absolute paths (starting with /), those paths don’t include the /appA prefix. This is a common issue
   when proxying applications that weren’t built to be hosted under a path prefix.

   Possible Solutions

**You have a couple of options to address this**:

   1. Use Nginx’s sub_filter to Rewrite Asset URLs
   You can modify your Nginx configuration to rewrite the asset URLs in the HTML responses so that they
   include the /appA prefix. For example:

   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   location /appA/ {
       proxy_pass http://3.250.227.215:2001/;
       proxy_redirect default;
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

       # Ensure the response is uncompressed for sub_filter to work
       proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding "";

       # Rewrite occurrences of href="/ and src="/ in the response body
       sub_filter 'href="/' 'href="/appA/';
       sub_filter 'src="/' 'src="/appA/';
       sub_filter_once off;
   }

**Note**:

   This works well for HTML responses but might not cover every case (e.g., dynamically generated
   JavaScript content).
   Ensure that the response isn’t gzipped (that's why we unset Accept-Encoding) so that sub_filter can
   properly inspect and modify the response.
   2. Serve the Application on a Subdomain
   If modifying the responses isn’t ideal or fully effective, another option is to serve each
   application on its own subdomain. For example:

   appA.myportal.com → proxies to http://3.250.227.215:2001/
   appB.myportal.com → proxies to http://3.250.227.215:2002/
   appC.myportal.com → proxies to http://3.250.227.215:2003/
   This way, the proxied app still lives at the root of its domain, and the absolute paths resolve
   correctly.

   3. (If Possible) Adjust the Application’s Base URL
   If you ever have the opportunity to adjust the application code, setting the HTML <base> tag can
   help. For example, in your app’s HTML:

   html
   Copy
   Edit
   <base href="/appA/">
   This instructs the browser to prepend /appA/ to all relative asset URLs. However, as you mentioned
   the applications cannot be changed, this option might not be feasible.

   Summary

**Problem**:

   The browser is requesting http://localhost/styles-5INURTSO.css because the app uses absolute paths
   for its assets.

**Solution Options**:

   Use Nginx’s sub_filter to rewrite asset URLs in the responses.
   Serve the application on a subdomain so that it remains at the root level.
   (If possible) Modify the app to use a <base> tag or relative URLs.
   Choose the solution that best fits your environment and constraints.

**You said**:

   Solution 2 really makes my ap dependent on the portal app, Or not?

**Chatgpt said**:

   Not really. Using subdomains is simply a way to map each application to a domain where it appears to
   live at the root, without modifying the applications themselves. Here’s what that means in practice:

   Routing vs. Dependency:
   By configuring your reverse proxy (or DNS) so that, for example, appA.myportal.com maps to
   http://3.250.227.215:2001/, you’re only affecting how users reach the application. The application
   itself remains completely independent—it isn’t aware whether it’s being accessed via
   appA.myportal.com or directly at its IP and port.

**No Code Coupling**:

   The applications don’t need to include any logic that depends on the portal’s routing. They continue
   to serve their content as if they were running at the root URL. The portal (or reverse proxy) is
   simply handling incoming requests and directing them appropriately.

   Infrastructure vs. Application Logic:
   While you do introduce a dependency on your reverse proxy/DNS configuration (which is true for many
   setups, such as microservices architectures), this dependency is on infrastructure rather than on
   the application code. If the reverse proxy goes down, yes, access through the portal would be
   affected, but the applications themselves remain autonomous. They can still be accessed directly
   (for example, via their original ports) if necessary.

**Unified Experience Without Tight Coupling**:

   Using subdomains lets you present a unified “portal” experience while keeping the apps decoupled.
   Each application remains responsible for its own logic and doesn’t have any embedded knowledge about
   being served from a particular subdomain—the reverse proxy configuration handles that translation.

   In summary, Solution 2 does not make your applications dependent on the portal application’s code.
   It only centralizes the routing and presentation layer. The applications continue to operate
   independently and can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately.

**You said**:

   Sorry. Iwanted to make the dependency objection for solution 3. There I have now a dependency, yes?

**Chatgpt said**:

   Yes, that's correct. With solution 3—modifying the application (for example, by adding a <base
   href="/appA/"> tag)—you introduce a dependency on the specific path or portal configuration. This
   means:

**Coupling to a Specific Path**:

   The application now assumes it will always be served from a particular subpath (e.g., /appA/). All
   asset URLs and relative links become dependent on that base URL.

**Deployment Constraints**:

   If you ever want to deploy the application outside of that portal context (or under a different
   subpath), you'll have to change the base reference in the application code. This reduces its
   independence.

**Code Changes**:

   Since your goal was to keep the applications independent (with no modifications to their code),
   solution 3 goes against that constraint by requiring you to alter the app.
   In summary, yes—solution 3 makes your application dependent on the portal's URL structure, and
   therefore it couples the app to that specific environment.

**You said**:

   Which rules out solution 3. Bad design !

**Chatgpt said**:

   That's exactly right. By modifying the application—for example, by adding a <base href="/appA/">
   tag—you make the app dependent on being served from a specific subpath. This creates tight coupling
   between the application and its hosting environment (the portal), which undermines the goal of
   keeping the applications independent.

   In short, solution 3 is generally considered a bad design for your scenario because:

**Tight Coupling**:

   The app now relies on the portal's URL structure, making it less portable.

**Reduced Flexibility**:

   If you need to serve the app from a different path or as a standalone, you'll have to update the
   application code.

**Maintenance Overhead**:

   Future changes to the deployment context may require corresponding changes in the application.
   So, it's best to avoid solution 3 and consider alternatives—like using subdomains or employing a
   reverse proxy with URL rewriting (e.g., using sub_filter)—to maintain the independence of your
   applications.

**You said**:

   I have this code now

           sub_filter 'content="/' 'content="/appC/';
           sub_filter_once off;
       }
   }

**Chatgpt said**:

   Your configuration shows that you’re using the sub_filter directives to rewrite asset references so
   that each application’s HTML (and other text responses) references resources with the correct
   subdirectory (e.g., /appA/). This is a common approach when you can’t change the upstream
   applications. Here are a few points and suggestions to consider:

   1. Ensure Correct Matching of Content

**Substitution Coverage**:

   You’re replacing occurrences of href="/, src="/, base href="/, and content="/ with versions that
   include the appropriate subpath. Make sure that these patterns match the way your upstream
   application is generating the URLs.

**Case Sensitivity**:

   Nginx’s sub_filter is case sensitive. Ensure that your upstream HTML uses exactly those lowercase
   attributes.

**Variants**:

   If there are variations (e.g., HREF="/ or additional whitespace), you may need additional directives
   or to standardize the upstream content.

**Sub_filter Types**:

   By default, sub_filter operates on responses with the MIME type text/html. If you need it to work on
   other types (like CSS or JavaScript) you may consider using the sub_filter_types directive:

   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   sub_filter_types text/html text/css application/javascript;
   2. Handling Compressed Responses

**Disabling Compression**:



**You already set**:

   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding "";
   This ensures that responses aren’t compressed, which is necessary for sub_filter to work properly.
   3. Potential Pitfalls

**Dynamic Content**:

   If the application generates URLs dynamically via JavaScript or through API responses that return
   JSON, those won’t necessarily be rewritten unless they fall under the MIME types you specify.
   Consider whether you need to address those cases.

**Edge Cases with Absolute Paths**:

   If your upstream applications sometimes use absolute URLs (e.g., http://3.250.227.215:2001/) instead
   of root-relative paths, the current filters won’t catch them. You may need additional filters if
   that’s the case.

**Performance**:

   Every response going through the proxy will be scanned and rewritten, which can have a performance
   impact if the responses are large or if there’s high traffic. Monitor performance to ensure that the
   rewriting doesn’t become a bottleneck.

   4. Testing Your Configuration

**Local Testing**:

   Make sure to test the output in the browser’s “View Source” and in developer tools (Network tab) to
   confirm that URLs are being rewritten correctly.

**Fallbacks**:

   It’s a good idea to test all possible asset types (images, stylesheets, scripts) to ensure they are
   served from the correct paths.

   5. Maintainability
   DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):
   Since the configuration for /appA/, /appB/, and /appC/ is nearly identical apart from the proxy pass
   URL and the sub_filter replacements, consider using an include file or a variable if your setup
   becomes more complex. This can help reduce duplication and errors in the configuration.
   Final Thoughts
   Your configuration is a solid approach for rewriting asset paths when the upstream applications
   can’t be modified. Just ensure that:

   The sub_filter patterns accurately reflect the content.
   You test with all necessary MIME types.
   You monitor performance to ensure the substitutions don’t impact response times significantly.
   This solution maintains the independence of your applications while letting the reverse proxy handle
   the URL rewriting transparently.

**You said**:

   But I still have this error

**Request URL**:



**http**:

   //localhost/styles-5INURTSO.css

**Request Method**:

   GET

**Status Code**:

   404 Not Found

**Remote Address**:

   [::1]:80

**Referrer Policy**:

   strict-origin-when-cross-origin

**Chatgpt said**:



**The fact that the browser is still trying to load**:

   arduino
   Copy
   Edit

**http**:

   //localhost/styles-5INURTSO.css
   indicates that the HTML (or other text) returned by your upstream application isn’t being rewritten
   as expected. Here are several things to check and try:

   1. Verify the Actual Upstream Content

**Inspect the HTML**:

   Use a tool like curl or your browser’s “View Source” on

   arduino
   Copy
   Edit

**http**:

   //localhost/appA/
   and check whether the asset URLs are rewritten. You should see references like

   html
   Copy
   Edit
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/appA/styles-5INURTSO.css">
   If they still appear as /styles-5INURTSO.css, then the sub_filter isn’t taking effect.

**Check the Exact Pattern**:

   The substitution rule

   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   sub_filter 'href="/' 'href="/appA/';
   will only match text exactly like href="/. If the upstream HTML uses any variation (for example,
   uppercase attributes, extra whitespace, or single quotes), the substitution won’t match. You might
   need additional sub_filter directives to catch those cases.

   2. Confirm the MIME Types Being Processed

**Default MIME Type Behavior**:

   By default, sub_filter applies only to responses with the MIME type text/html. If your HTML response
   has a different content type or if the asset references are generated in another MIME type, they
   might not be processed.

   Apply to All Types (for Testing):

**You can temporarily set**:

   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   sub_filter_types *;
   This tells Nginx to apply the sub_filter to every response type. If this fixes the issue, you can
   then narrow it down as needed.

   3. Check Proxy Buffering and Response Processing

**Proxy Buffering**:

   In some cases, buffering can affect how sub_filter processes the response. Try disabling buffering
   for testing:

   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   proxy_buffering off;
   Place this inside your location block (e.g., for /appA/) to ensure the entire response is processed
   by sub_filter.

**Ensure Uncompressed Content**:

   You’re already setting:

   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding "";
   so that’s good. This ensures the response isn’t gzipped (which is required for sub_filter to work).

   4. Consider the Order of Processing

**Response Chunking**:

   If the response is sent in chunks, sometimes the substitution might not see the full pattern in one
   chunk. This is less common but something to keep in mind. Disabling buffering (as shown above) can
   help.
   5. Debugging Steps

**Test with a Minimal Example**:

   Create a small HTML file that mimics the upstream output. Serve it locally and run your sub_filter
   rules against it. This can help you confirm whether the patterns you’re using are correct.

**Log the Upstream Response**:

   Temporarily log the full response from the upstream server (using a tool or even temporarily
   modifying the app) to see what the asset references look like.

   Summary
   Your configuration is on the right track. The 404 error indicates that the asset URLs in the HTML
   are still using the root path (/styles-5INURTSO.css) instead of including the subpath
   (/appA/styles-5INURTSO.css). To resolve this:

   Inspect the actual HTML coming from the proxy to see if the sub_filter replacements are applied.
   Ensure that the patterns in sub_filter match exactly what’s in the HTML (consider potential
   variations).
   Use sub_filter_types *; temporarily to verify that MIME type filtering isn’t blocking your
   substitutions.
   Disable proxy buffering to make sure sub_filter has access to the complete response.
   Once the upstream HTML is correctly rewritten, your browser should request the assets from
   /appA/styles-5INURTSO.css, and your reverse proxy will correctly forward them to the appropriate
   backend.

**You said**:

   this application is an angular application and files are being distributed under /dist
   does that help?

**Chatgpt said**:

   Knowing that your application is built with Angular and its assets are generated in the /dist folder
   does add some context. Angular applications—when built with the Angular CLI—by default set their
   base URL to the root (i.e. <base href="/">) and generate absolute asset references in the built
   index.html (and sometimes in JavaScript). Here are some points that might help you troubleshoot and
   decide on a solution:

   1. Angular’s Base Href and Absolute Asset Paths

**Default Behavior**:

   By default, Angular sets <base href="/"> in index.html. This causes asset URLs (CSS, JavaScript,
   images, etc.) to be referenced with absolute paths (e.g., /styles-5INURTSO.css).

**Issue When Proxied**:

   When you reverse proxy this app behind /appA/, the browser will still look for assets at
   http://localhost/styles-5INURTSO.css unless the paths are rewritten.
   2. Using Sub_Filter

**Your Configuration**:

   You’re attempting to rewrite occurrences of
   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   href="/
   to
   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   href="/appA/
   and similarly for base href=", src=", etc. This should work if the upstream HTML contains exactly
   these patterns.

**Potential Pitfalls**:



**Dynamic Content**:

   Angular might load some assets dynamically via JavaScript, which may not be caught by sub_filter if
   the output isn’t plain text or isn’t of a type that sub_filter processes by default.

**Multiple References**:

   If the Angular build outputs references that don’t match your literal patterns (for instance, extra
   spaces or different quote styles), the rewrite won’t occur.

**Fallback for Deep Links**:

   Angular uses client-side routing, so if a user navigates to a deep link (e.g., /appA/some/route),
   you may need to configure a fallback (try_files) so that the Angular router can handle it.
   3. Considerations for an Angular Application

**Option A**:

   Adjust the Angular Build
   If possible (and if you’re allowed even minimal changes), consider building the Angular application
   with a custom base href:

   bash
   Copy
   Edit
   ng build --prod --base-href /appA/
   This way, the generated index.html and asset references will be correct from the start, eliminating
   the need for sub_filter rewrites.
   However, since you mentioned that you do not want to modify the application code or build, this
   might not be acceptable.

**Option B**:

   Enhance Your Nginx Rewrite Setup
   Since you cannot change the Angular build, you must rely on Nginx to rewrite the HTML responses. To
   help ensure that the rewrites catch everything:

**Check the Output**:

   Inspect the HTML (using the browser’s “View Source” or by using curl) from http://localhost/appA/ to
   see if the asset URLs have been rewritten. If you still see absolute paths like
   /styles-5INURTSO.css, then the sub_filter isn’t catching those parts.

**Broaden MIME Types**:



**You can temporarily set**:

   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   sub_filter_types *;
   to ensure all response types are processed. If this helps, then narrow it down to the appropriate
   types.

**Disable Buffering**:

   Ensure that Nginx isn’t chunking responses in a way that interferes with sub_filter:
   nginx
   Copy
   Edit
   proxy_buffering off;

**Verify Patterns**:

   Double-check that the patterns in sub_filter match exactly what the Angular app outputs. For
   instance, if the Angular app outputs <base href="/">, your rewrite for 'base href="/' should catch
   that. If there are variations, you may need additional or adjusted patterns.

**Option C**:

   Use a Different Approach (Subdomains)
   As an alternative, you could consider serving the Angular app on its own subdomain (e.g.,
   appA.myportal.com). This would let the app run at the root of its domain so that the absolute asset
   references resolve correctly. However, this means changing how your portal is structured, which you
   may or may not prefer.

   4. Summary
   Angular’s Default Output:
   Angular is outputting asset URLs based on a root (/) base href. When served behind /appA/, this
   causes 404 errors since the browser looks for assets at http://localhost/… rather than
   http://localhost/appA/….

**Your Current Approach**:

   Using sub_filter to rewrite HTML should work, but you must verify that the rewrite patterns match
   exactly what Angular outputs.

**Potential Enhancements**:

   Temporarily allow sub_filter on all MIME types with sub_filter_types *;.
   Disable proxy buffering.
   Confirm that the Angular HTML really contains the patterns you're rewriting.
   Consider a fallback for Angular’s client-side routing (e.g., using try_files in your location
   block).
   If after these checks the asset URLs still aren’t rewritten as expected, then the Angular app might
   be loading some assets dynamically or in a way that isn’t caught by sub_filter. In that case,
   revisiting the deployment strategy (like using subdomains or adjusting the build) might be
   necessary.

   In short, knowing that it’s an Angular app tells us that asset references are likely hard-coded for
   root deployment, which is why the sub_filter (or an alternative solution) is needed to adapt them
   for your portal’s subpath setup.

**You said**:

   Maybe reverse proxy was not a good idea. Is there a better idea? What did you say about deep
   linking?

**Chatgpt said**:

   When you encounter issues with rewriting asset URLs in a reverse proxy—especially with an Angular
   application that relies on deep linking—a different approach can simplify your setup. Here’s some
   context and alternatives:

   Deep Linking in Angular

**What It Is**:

   Deep linking means that a URL can directly reference an internal route of your Angular application
   (e.g., http://localhost/appA/some/route). The Angular router interprets that URL to display the
   appropriate view.

**Server-Side Fallback**:

   For deep links to work, your server must be configured so that if a user directly navigates to a
   nested URL, the server always returns the Angular app’s index.html. In an Nginx reverse proxy, you’d
   typically use a fallback (e.g., via try_files) so that non-existent files are redirected to
   index.html.
   Challenges with Reverse Proxying Angular Apps Under a Subdirectory

**Asset URL Rewriting**:

   Angular’s build process assumes the app is served at the root (e.g., <base href="/">). When you
   proxy it under /appA/, asset references like /styles-5INURTSO.css cause 404 errors unless you
   rewrite them. Your current approach with sub_filter tries to do this, but it can be brittle:

   The patterns must match exactly.
   Some assets might be loaded dynamically or not match the patterns you expect.
   Extra configuration (like disabling proxy buffering or adjusting MIME types) is required.

**Deep Linking Complexity**:

   Even if you get asset paths rewritten, you also need to ensure that deep links (e.g.,
   http://localhost/appA/some/route) work correctly. That means setting up Nginx so that any unknown
   URL under /appA/ falls back to index.html for the Angular router to take over.

**A Better Alternative**:

   Using Subdomains

**Using subdomains can sidestep many of these issues**:



**How It Works**:

   Instead of serving your Angular app behind a subdirectory (like /appA/), you serve it on its own
   subdomain. For example:

   appA.myportal.com → proxies to http://3.250.227.215:2001/
   appB.myportal.com → proxies to http://3.250.227.215:2002/
   appC.myportal.com → proxies to http://3.250.227.215:2003/

**Advantages**:



**No Asset Rewriting Needed**:

   The Angular app is served from the root of the subdomain. Its absolute asset paths (e.g.,
   /styles-5INURTSO.css) will resolve correctly because they refer to the subdomain root.

**Seamless Deep Linking**:

   With the app at the root, deep linking works naturally. The Angular router can handle URLs like
   appA.myportal.com/some/route without additional server-side rewriting.

**Less Configuration Complexity**:

   You eliminate the need for sub_filter and the extra logic to handle missing trailing slashes or
   proxy buffering issues.
   The Portal’s Role:
   Your portal can simply provide navigation (links or buttons) to these subdomains. The applications
   remain independent and need no internal modifications for routing or asset management.

   Summary

**Reverse Proxy Under a Subdirectory**:

   While possible, this approach requires careful rewriting of asset URLs and additional configuration
   (like fallback routing for deep links). It can be brittle, especially with an Angular build that
   expects to be served at the root.

**Subdomain Approach**:

   Serving each Angular app on its own subdomain (e.g., appA.myportal.com) avoids the need for
   rewriting URLs. Deep linking works naturally, and the Angular apps remain fully independent. Your
   portal would simply link to these subdomains, and each app operates in its expected environment.

   Given the challenges with rewriting and deep linking in your reverse proxy setup, using subdomains
   is often a cleaner and more robust solution for Angular applications.
